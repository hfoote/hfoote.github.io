		<h3>Mapping the Dark Matter Wake Induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud</h3>

		<p class="caption" style="max-width: 500px;">A kernel density plot of one of my wake formation simulations with cold dark matter, projected along the z-axis. The color shows the density contrast of the background "wind" dark matter particles as they move in the +y-direction past a dark matter halo at the center of the box (not shown).</p>
		<p>My current research project is centered on the interaction between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and our own Milky Way (MW) galaxy. The LMC is the MW's largest satellite galaxy, and it has recently (cosmologically speaking) reached its first pericenter passage about 40 million years ago. As the LMC falls through the MW's dark matter halo, its gravity attracts the MW's dark matter to it, forming an overdense region in the MW's halo which traces the path of the LMC's orbit. This gravitational "wake" pulls back on the LMC and slows it down in a process called dynamical friction. </p>
		<p>The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing mysteries in astronomy. The LMC's wake is a promising observable for distinguishing between competing dark matter models, as the strength and morphology of the wake depends on the microphysics of the dark matter particle. I am creating a suite of windtunnel-style simulations of the formation of the LMC's wake under different assumptions for the underlying dark matter physics. When compared with observations of the wake's imprint on the MW's stellar halo, my models will provide a tool for constraining dark matter physics. </p>

		<h3>The Structure of Eccentric Nuclear Disks</h3>
		<img class="pageimage" src="/images/aBySim.png" alt="Mass segregation plot" style="height:auto;max-width:760px;">
		<p class="caption" style="max-width: 760px;">The mean semimajor axis of both stellar populations (heavy/light stars) as a function of time in my simulations. Each color line represents a different simulation with a different number of heavy stars. Mass segregation is apparent as the heavy population having lower semimajor axes than the light population. The number of heavy stars also affects the strength of the mass segregation.</p>
		<p>As an undergraduate at CU Boulder, my honors thesis explored the internal structure of eccentric nuclear disks (ENDs), a type of star cluster found in galaxy nuclei where the stellar orbits about the supermassive black hole are highly eccentric and spatially aligned. I wrote a suite of <i>N</i>-body simulations that for the first time studied mass segregation in ENDs, a dynamical process found in more common types of star clusters by which the heaviest members sink to the center of the cluster. My simulations confirmed that mass segregation operates in ENDs as it does in spherical clusters and axisymmetric disks. </p>
		<p>ENDs are also known for producing an elevated number of tidal disruption events (TDEs), where a star wanders too close to the supermassive black hole and is ripped apart by tidal forces. I also showed that mass segregation causes the most massive objects in an END to be more susceptible to tidal disruption when compared to less massive objects. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..175F/abstract">Read more here.</a></p>
